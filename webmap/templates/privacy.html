							</p>
							<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">II. Data Protection Officer</h2>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Since the type and scope of data processing at RLI do not meet the criteria set out in Article 37 (1) of the GDPR and Section 38 (1) sentence 1 of the new BDSG, no data protection officer has been appointed. </p>
							<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">III. General information on data processing</h2>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">1. Scope of the processing of personal data</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"> We process personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary for the provision of a functional website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only after consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for technical reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by legal regulations. </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Art. 6 (1) lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
								When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) lit. b of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
								In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make it necessary to process personal data, Art. 6 (1) lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.
								If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing. </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">3. Data deletion and storage duration</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The personal data of the data subject shall be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Storage may also take place if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or other provisions to which the responsible party is subject. Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.</p>
							<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">IV. Provision of the website and creation of log files</h2>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. The following data is collected: </p>
							<ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
								<li class="mb-2">Information about the browser type and version used</li>
								<li class="mb-2">The operating system of the user</li>
								<li class="mb-2">The Internet service provider of the user</li>
								<li class="mb-2">The IP address of the user</li>

								<li class="mb-2">Websites from which the user's system accesses our Internet site</li>
								<li class="mb-2">Websites that are called up by the user's system via our website</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The data is also stored in the log files of our system. A storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place. </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">2. Legal basis for data processing </h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">3. Purpose of data processing</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to the user's computer. For this purpose, the user's IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session.
								The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
								These purposes are also our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">4. Duration of storage</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case,when the respective session is finished.
								In the case of storage of data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage beyond this period is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible. </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">5. Possibility of objection and removal</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user. </p>
							<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">VI. E-mail contact</h2>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">If a user wants to leave a feedback, the feedback formular requires a contact email from the user. If a user makes use of this option, the personal data of the user transmitted with the e-mail will be stored.
								In this context, the data will not be passed on to third parties. The data is used exclusively for the processing of the conversation.  </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">2. Legal basis for data processing </h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR if the user has given his consent.
								The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an e-mail is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. If the e-mail contact aims at the conclusion of a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR   </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">3. Purpose of data processing</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">In the case of contact by e-mail, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in processing the data.</p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">4. Duration of storage</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. For personal data sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation is ended when it is clear from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified. </p>
							<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">5. Possibility of objection and removal</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The user has the option to revoke his consent to the processing of personal data at any time. If the user contacts us by e-mail, he can object to the storage of his personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued.
								The revocation of consent can be made informally by e-mail or in writing.
								In this case, all personal data stored in the course of contacting us will be deleted within 10 working days.</p>
